Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",

    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order. The first two rows of your answer should include postal code 94107 and 94124.\n",

    "This distribution peaks at higher values (scores of 90-100) and has a long tail from (0-90). This distribution is not normal and skews right. There are some very distinct gaps among the peak. Specifically, these gaps occur between 90-100. This likely implies that when a business is ultimately in good shape (has a good score), they are generally docked points for issues that carry point values of 2+. For example, there are 0 businesses that scored 99, but plenty (1086 to be exact) that scored 98. There also happens to be anamolously low scores in the low 90s. Maybe explained by a similar reason -- just the math happened to work out in a certain way."

    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

If the data points fall above 0, then that indicates a positive difference (increase) from the first score to the second score. In the histogram, again, we do see a bit more of the counts lean towards the right side of 0. Again, we would need to conduct further statistical analysis to parse apart the significance of this."
